Abstract
"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by progressive loss of selectively vulnerable populations of neurons, which contrasts with select static neuronal loss because of metabolic or toxic disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases can be classified according to primary clinical features (e.g., dementia, parkinsonism, or motor neuron disease), anatomic distribution of neurodegeneration (e.g., frontotemporal degenerations, extrapyramidal disorders, or spinocerebellar degenerations), or principal molecular abnormality. The most common neurodegenerative disorders are amyloidoses, tauopathies, α-synucleinopathies, and TDP-43 proteinopathies. The protein abnormalities in these disorders have abnormal conformational properties. Growing experimental evidence suggests that abnormal protein conformers may spread from cell to cell along anatomically connected pathways, which may in part explain the specific anatomical patterns observed at autopsy. In this review, we detail the human pathology of select neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on their main protein aggregates."
"Many lines of evidence suggest that mitochondria have a central role in ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are critical regulators of cell death, a key feature of neurodegeneration. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA and oxidative stress both contribute to ageing, which is the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. In all major examples of these diseases there is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an impressive number of disease-specific proteins interact with mitochondria. Thus, therapies targeting basic mitochondrial processes, such as energy metabolism or free-radical generation, or specific interactions of disease-related proteins with mitochondria, hold great promise."

"One of the most striking hallmarks shared by various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Increasing evidence indicates that microglial activation in the central nervous system is heterogeneous, which can be categorized into two opposite types: M1 phenotype and M2 phenotype. Depending on the phenotypes activated, microglia can produce either cytotoxic or neuroprotective effects. In this review, we focus on the potential role of M1 and M2 microglia and the dynamic changes of M1/M2 phenotypes that are critically associated with the neurodegenerative diseases. Generally, M1 microglia predominate at the injury site at the end stage of disease, when the immunoresolution and repair process of M2 microglia are dampened. This phenotype transformation is very complicated in AD due to the phagocytosis of regionally distributed β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque and tangles that are released into the extracellular space. The endogenous stimuli including aggregated α-synuclein, mutated superoxide dismutase, Aβ, and tau oligomers exist in the milieu that may persistently activate M1 pro-inflammatory responses and finally lead to irreversible neuron loss. The changes of microglial phenotypes depend on the disease stages and severity; mastering the stage-specific switching of M1/M2 phenotypes within appropriate time windows may provide better therapeutic benefit."
"Clinical gene therapy has made important advances over the last decade. Among neurological diseases, severe genetic neurodegenerative conditions have been the focus of initial clinical applications. Gene therapy has also addressed complex neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease, with encouraging results in human patients, demonstrating that specific targeting of central nervous system (CNS) cells is a relevant strategy for severe pathologies and that efficient access to the CNS with viral vectors is an achievable goal. The purpose of this review is to summarize the gene therapy clinical applications that have been conducted for neurodegenerative diseases. Limitations and hurdles to obtain and demonstrate benefit in patients, and the new developments that should allow new clinical applications with high beneficial potential are discussed."
"Neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases cause considerable human suffering, and therapy options for these two disease categories are limited or non-existing. It is an emerging notion that neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases are linked in several ways, and in this review, we discuss the current status regarding vascular dysregulation in neurodegenerative disease, and conversely, how cerebrovascular diseases are associated with central nervous system (CNS) degeneration and dysfunction. The emerging links between neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases are reviewed with a particular focus on pericytes-important cells that ensheath the endothelium in the microvasculature and which are pivotal for blood-brain barrier function and cerebral blood flow. Finally, we address how novel molecular and cellular insights into pericytes and other vascular cell types may open new avenues for diagnosis and therapy development for these important diseases."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all neural cells, including neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. The lack of adequate technology has not halted neuroscientists from investigating EVs as a mean to decipher neurodegenerative disorders, still in search of comprehensible pathogenic mechanisms and efficient treatment. EVs are thought to be one of ways neurodegenerative pathologies spread in the brain, but also one of the ways the brain tries to displace toxic proteins, making their meaning in pathogenesis uncertain. EVs, however do reach biological fluids where they can be analyzed, and might therefore constitute clinically decisive biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases in the future. Finally, if they constitute a physiological inter-cell communication system, they may represent also a very specific drug delivery tool for a difficult target such as the brain. We try to resume here available information on the role of EVs in neurodegeneration, with a special focus on Alzheimer's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic and rare hereditary disorders of the central nervous system, which cause a slowly progressive loss of function of specific neuron populations and their connections. Severe impairments and care dependency can be the sequelae. Neurodegenerative disorders are diseases of older people; therefore, the demographic shift leads to an increase in the number of affected patients. Radiologists will also become more involved. For this reason important neurodegenerative diseases are presented in this article. In addition to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases these also include frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Huntington's chorea. The clinical symptoms and diagnostics are described, whereby the focus lies on typical results of morphological imaging."
"Neuronal cell death in the central nervous system has always been a challenging process to decipher. In normal physiological conditions, neuronal cell death is restricted in the adult brain, even in aged individuals. However, in the pathological conditions of various neurodegenerative diseases, cell death and shrinkage in a specific region of the brain represent a fundamental pathological feature across different neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will briefly go through the general pathways of cell death and describe evidence for cell death in the context of individual common neurodegenerative diseases, discussing our current understanding of cell death by connecting with renowned pathogenic proteins, including Tau, amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin and TDP-43."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are a growing health concern. The increasing incidences of these disorders have a great impact on the patients' quality of life. Although the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases are still far from being clarified, several studies look for new discoveries about their pathophysiology and prevention. Furthermore, evidence has shown a strong correlation between obesity and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Metabolic changes caused by overweight are related to damage to the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to neural death, either by apoptosis or cell necrosis, as well as alter the synaptic plasticity of the neuron. This review aims to show the association between neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on AD and PD, and metabolic alterations."
"Most common neurodegenerative diseases feature deposition of protein amyloids and degeneration of brain networks. Amyloids are ordered protein assemblies that can act as templates for their own replication through monomer addition. Evidence suggests that this characteristic may underlie the progression of pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. Many different amyloid proteins, including Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein, exhibit properties similar to those of infectious prion protein in experimental systems: discrete and self-replicating amyloid structures, transcellular propagation of aggregation, and transmissible neuropathology. This review discusses the contribution of prion phenomena and transcellular propagation to the progression of pathology in common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. It reviews fundamental events such as cell entry, amplification, and transcellular movement. It also discusses amyloid strains, which produce distinct patterns of neuropathology and spread through the nervous system. These concepts may impact the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
"Disorders of sleep are an integral part of neurodegenerative diseases and include insomnia, sleep-wake cycle disruption, excessive daytime sleepiness that may be manifested as persistent somnolence or sudden onset of sleep episodes, obstructive and central sleep apnea, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. The origin of these sleep disorders is multifactorial including degeneration of the brain areas that modulate sleep, the symptoms of the disease, and the effect of medications. Treatment of sleep disorders in patients with neurodegenerative diseases should be individualized and includes behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene, bright light therapy, melatonin, hypnotics, waking-promoting agents, and continuous positive airway pressure."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders characterized by progressive loss of neurons associated with deposition of proteins showing altered physicochemical properties in the brain and in peripheral organs. Molecular classification of neurodegenerative disease is protein-based. This emphasizes the role of protein-processing systems in the pathogenesis. The most frequent proteins involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases are amyloid-β, prion protein, tau, α-synuclein, TAR-DNA-binding protein 43kDa, and fused-in sarcoma protein. There are further proteins associated mostly with hereditary disorders such as proteins encoded by genes linked to trinucleotide repeat disorders, neuroserpin, ferritin, and familial cerebral amyloidoses. The clinical presentations are defined by the distinct involvement of functional systems and do not necessarily indicate the molecular pathologic background. Seeding of pathologic proteins and hierarchic involvement of anatomic regions is commonly seen in neurodegenerative diseases. Overlap of neurodegenerative diseases and combinations of different disorders is frequent. Translation of neuropathologic categories of neurodegenerative diseases into in vivo detectable biomarkers is only partly achieved but intensive research is performed to reach this goal."
"Prions are notorious protein-only infectious agents that cause invariably fatal brain diseases following silent incubation periods that can span a lifetime. These diseases can arise spontaneously, through infection or be inherited. Remarkably, prions are composed of self-propagating assemblies of a misfolded cellular protein that encode information, generate neurotoxicity and evolve and adapt in vivo. Although parallels have been drawn with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions involving the deposition of assemblies of misfolded proteins in the brain, insights are now being provided into the usefulness and limitations of prion analogies and their aetiological and therapeutic relevance."
"When thinking about neurodegenerative diseases, the first symptoms that come to mind are loss of memory and learning capabilities, which all resemble hallmarks of manifestation of such diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the gut comprises the largest nervous system outside the CNS that is autonomously active and in close interplay with its microbiota. Therefore, the enteric nervous system (ENS) might serve as an indicator of degenerative pathomechanisms that also affect the CNS. On the other hand, it might offer an entry point for devastating influences from the microbial community or - conversely - for therapeutic approaches via gut commensals. Within the last years, the ENS and gut microbiota therefore have sparked the interest of researchers of CNS diseases and we here report on recent findings and open questions, especially with regard to Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases."
"Prions are defined as proteinaceous infectious particles that do not contain nucleic acids. Neuropathological investigations of post-mortem brains and recent studies of experimental transmission have suggested that amyloid-like abnormal protein aggregates, which are the defining feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, behave like prions and propagate throughout the brain. This prion-like propagation may be the underlying mechanism of onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, although the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. However, in vitro and in vivo experimental models of prion-like propagation using pathogenic protein seeds are well established and are extremely valuable for the exploration and evaluation of novel drugs and therapies for neurodegenerative diseases for which there is no effective treatment. In this chapter, we introduce the experimental models of prion-like propagation of α-synuclein, which is accumulated in Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, and we describe their applications for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. We also introduce the concept of ""α-syn strains,"" which may underlie the pathological and clinical diversity of α-synucleinopathies."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders that are characterized by a progressive decline of the motor and/or cognitive function caused by a selective loss of neurons within the central nervous system. Recent advancements in the translational research have facilitated extensive insights into the molecular pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Nonetheless, a myriad of compounds that suppressed the disease progression in cellular and animal models did not exhibit efficacy in clinical trials. Perhaps, various biological, medical, and methodological factors could be attributed to unfavorable results of clinical trials of such disease-modifying therapies. Primarily, the fact that pathological changes at molecular and cellular levels precede the clinical onset by several years underscores a pressing need for the initiation of interventions before the emergence of neurological symptoms. Using exquisite biomarkers, recent studies revealed the preclinical and prodromal progression of pathophysiology, as well as compensatory brain responses in several neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to discuss the recent advancement of biomarker studies on presymptomatic subjects and the perspective on a preventive trial of disease-modifying therapies for devastating neurological disorders."
"Objective: A comprehensive review of the network regulation of exosomes and microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurodegenerative diseases was done, centering on the mechanism of the formation of exosomes and miRNAs and the sorting mechanism of exosomal miRNAs, with the aim to provide a theoretical basis in the search of biomarkers and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Data sources: The comprehensive search used online literature databases including NCBI PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Baidu Scholar. Study selection: The study selection was based on the following keywords: exosomes, miRNAs, central nervous system (CNS), and neurodegenerative diseases. The time limit for literature retrieval was from the year 2000 to 2018, with language restriction in English. Relevant articles were carefully reviewed, with no exclusions applied to study design and publication type. Results: Exosomes are the smallest nanoscale membranous microvesicles secreted by cells and contain important miRNAs, among other rich contents. In the CNS, exosomes can transport amyloid β-protein, α-synuclein, Huntington-associated protein 1, and superoxide dismutase I to other cells. These events relieve the abnormal accumulation of proteins and aggravating neurological diseases. In some neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, miRNAs are pathologically altered as an inexorable course, suggesting that miRNAs may contribute neurodegeneration. Exosomes and miRNAs form a network to regulate the homeostasis of the CNS, both synergistically and individually. Conclusion: The network of exosomes and miRNAs that regulates CNS homeostasis is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."
"Over the past decades, cell apoptosis has been significantly reputed as an accidental, redundant and alternative manner of cell demise which partakes in homeostasis in the development of extensive diseases. Nevertheless, necroptosis, another novel manner of cell death through a caspase-independent way, especially in neurodegenerative diseases remains ambiguous. The cognition of this form of cell demise is helpful to understand other forms of morphological resemblance of necrosis. Additionally, the concrete signal mechanism in the regulation of necroptosis is beneficial to the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that necroptotic inhibitor, 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol and partial specific histone deacetylase inhibitors could alleviate pathogenetic conditions of neurodegenerative diseases via necroptosis pathway. In this review, we summarize recent researches about mechanisms and modulation of necroptotic signaling pathways and probe into the role of programmed necroptotic cell demise in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
"Neurodegeneration, the slow and progressive dysfunction and loss of neurons and axons in the central nervous system, is the primary pathological feature of acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, neurotropic viral infections, stroke, paraneoplastic disorders, traumatic brain injury and multiple sclerosis. Despite different triggering events, a common feature is chronic immune activation, in particular of microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. Apart from the pathogenic role of immune responses, emerging evidence indicates that immune responses are also critical for neuroregeneration. Here, we review the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses on the central nervous system in autoimmune, viral and other neurodegenerative disorders, and discuss their contribution to either damage or repair. We also discuss potential therapies aimed at the immune responses within the central nervous system. A better understanding of the interaction between the immune and nervous systems will be crucial to either target pathogenic responses, or augment the beneficial effects of immune responses as a strategy to intervene in chronic neurodegenerative diseases."
"The notion that one common pathogenic pathway could account for the various clinically distinguishable, typically late-onset neurodegenerative diseases might appear unlikely given the plethora of diverse primary causes of neurodegeneration. On the contrary, an autoinflammatory pathogenic mechanism allows diverse genetic and environmental factors to converge into a common chain of causality. Inflammation has long been known to correlate with neurodegeneration. Until recently this relationship was seen as one of consequence rather than cause-with inflammatory cells and events acting to 'clean up the mess' after neurological injury. This explanation is demonstrably inadequate and it is now clear that inflammation is at the very least, rate-limiting for neurodegeneration (and more likely, a principal underlying cause in most if not all neurodegenerative diseases), protective in its initial acute phase, but pernicious in its latter chronic phase."
"The neuropathology of different neurodegenerative diseases begins in different brain regions, and involves distinct brain networks. Evidence indicates that transcellular propagation of protein aggregation, which is the basis of prion disease, might underlie the progression of pathology in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. The prion model predicts specific patterns of neuronal vulnerability and network involvement on the basis of the conformation of pathological proteins. Indeed, evidence indicates that self-propagating aggregate conformers, or so-called strains, are associated with distinct neuropathological syndromes. The extension of this hypothesis to our understanding of common neurodegenerative disorders can suggest new therapeutic approaches, such as immunotherapy and small molecules, to block transcellular propagation, and new diagnostic tools to detect early evidence of disease."
"The increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases represents a huge challenge for societies. These diseases are characterized by neuronal death and include several different pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Most of these pathologies are often associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins, such as amyloid-ß, tau, α-synuclein, huntingtin and prion proteins. However, the precise mechanisms that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death in these diseases remain poorly understood. Nucleic acid aptamers represent a new class of ligands that could be useful to better understand these diseases and develop better diagnosis and therapy. In this review, several of these aptamers are presented as well as their applications for neurodegenerative diseases."
"Sex differences have been clinically documented in numerous neurodegenerative diseases and yet the reasons for these differences are not well understood. Recent studies have found that microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, are a key cell type involved in neurodegenerative diseases. This cell type displays sex differences in their expression profiles and function. Could these sex differences in microglia explain the sex differences seen in neurodegenerative diseases? How can we further probe these differences to better understand disease mechanisms? In this Opinion, we highlight the recent evidence that microglia have sex differences, factors that contribute to these differences, and how these differences could shed new light on the pathophysiology of neurological diseases."
"Stem cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases aim at halting clinical deterioration by regeneration and by providing local support for damaged tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great potential for cell therapy as they can be efficiently derived from adult tissue, ex vivo expanded in culture and safely transplanted autologously. MSCs were also shown to be able to differentiate toward neural fates and to secrete a broad range of factors able to promote nervous tissue maintenance and repair. Moreover, upon transplantation, MSCs were shown capable of homing toward lesioned areas, implying their potential use as vehicles for therapeutic agents administration. Indeed, various advantageous effects were reported following human MSCs transplantation into rodent models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as neurotrophic factor-mediated protection, enhanced neurogenesis, modulation of inflammation, and abnormal protein aggregate clearance. Per journal style, most nonstandard abbreviations must be used at least two times in the abstract to be retained; NTF was used once and thus has been deleted. Recent studies have also used ex vivo manipulation for enhanced expression of potentially favorable factors, by so exploiting the homing capacity of MSCs for effective expression at the lesion site. Here, we will summarize current advancements in MSCs-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. We will examine the roles of central mechanisms suggested to mediate the beneficial effects of MSCs-based therapy and consider the augmentation of these mechanisms for superior clinical outcomes in rodent models of neurodegeneration as well as in clinical trials.

"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts with low protein-coding potential but occupy a large part of transcriptional output. Their roles include regulating gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional level in cellular homeostasis. However, lncRNA studies are still in their infancy and the functions of the vast majority of lncRNA transcripts remain unknown. It is generally known that the function of the human nervous system largely relies on the precise regulation of gene expression. Various studies have shown that lncRNAs have a significant impact on normal neural development and on the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we focused on recent studies associated with lncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple system atrophy (MSA), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and glaucoma. Glaucoma, caused by unexplained ganglion cell lesion and apoptosis, is now labeled as a chronic neurodegenerative disorder [1], and therefore, we discussed the association of lncRNAs with glaucoma as well. We illustrate the role of some specific lncRNAs, which may provide new insights into our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative diseases mentioned above."
"Sphingolipids (SL) modulate several cellular processes including cell death, proliferation and autophagy. The conversion of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and the balance between ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), also known as the SL rheostat, have been associated with oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Research in the last decade has focused on the possibility of targeting the SL metabolism as a therapeutic option; and SL levels in biofluids, including serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have been measured in several neurodegenerative diseases with the aim of finding a diagnostic or prognostic marker. Previous reviews focused on results from diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), evaluated total SL or species levels in human biofluids, post-mortem tissues and/or animal models. However, a comprehensive review of SL alterations comparing results from several neurodegenerative diseases is lacking. The present work compiles data from circulating sphingolipidomic studies and attempts to elucidate a possible connection between certain SL species and neurodegeneration processes. Furthermore, the effects of ceramide species according to their acyl-chain length in cellular pathways such as apoptosis and proliferation are discussed in order to understand the impact of the level alteration in specific species. Finally, enzymatic regulations and the possible influence of insulin resistance in the level alteration of SL are evaluated."
"Degenerative diseases of the nervous system impose substantial medical and public health burdens on populations throughout the world. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are three of the major neurodegenerative diseases. The prevalence and incidence of these diseases rise dramatically with age; thus the number of cases is expected to increase for the foreseeable future as life spans in many countries continue to increase. Causal contributions from genetic and environmental factors are, with some exceptions, poorly understood. Nonetheless, molecular epidemiology approaches have proven valuable for improving disease diagnoses, characterizing disease prognostic factors, identifying high-risk genes for familial neurodegenerative diseases, investigating common genetic variants that may predict susceptibility for the non-familial forms of these diseases, and for quantifying environmental exposures. Incorporation of molecular techniques, including genomics, proteomics, and measurements of environmental toxicant body burdens into epidemiologic research, offer considerable promise for enhancing progress on characterizing pathogenesis mechanisms and identifying specific risk factors, especially for the non-familial forms of these diseases. In this chapter, brief overviews are provided of the epidemiologic features of PD, AD, and ALS, as well as illustrative examples in which molecular epidemiologic approaches have advanced knowledge on underlying disease mechanisms and risk factors that might lead to improved medical management and ultimately disease prevention. The chapter concludes with some recommendations for future molecular epidemiology research."
"Neurodegeneration is a feature of many debilitating, incurable diseases that are rapidly rising in prevalence, such as Parkinson's disease. There is an urgent need to develop new and more effective therapeutic strategies to combat these devastating diseases. Models - from cell-based systems, to unicellular organisms, to complex animals - have proven to be a useful tool to help the research community shed light on the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, and these advances have now begun to provide promising therapeutic avenues. In this themed issue of Disease Models & Mechanisms, a special collection of articles focused on neurodegenerative diseases is introduced. The collection includes original research articles that provide new insights into the complex pathophysiology of such diseases, revealing candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Some of the articles describe a new disease model that enables deeper exploration of key mechanisms. We also present a series of reviews that highlight some of the recent translational advances made in studies of neurodegenerative diseases. In this Editorial, we summarize the articles featured in this collection, emphasizing the impact that model-based studies have made in this exciting area of research."
"In our ageing population, neurodegenerative disorders carry an enormous personal, societal and economic burden. Although neurodegenerative diseases are often thought of as clinicopathological entities, increasing evidence suggests a considerable overlap in the molecular underpinnings of their pathogenesis. Such overlapping biological processes include the handling of misfolded proteins, defective organelle trafficking, RNA processing, synaptic health and neuroinflammation. Collectively but in different proportions, these biological processes in neurons or non-neuronal cells lead to regionally distinct patterns of neuronal vulnerability and progression of pathology that could explain the disease symptomology. With the advent of patient-derived cellular models and novel genetic manipulation tools, we are now able to interrogate this commonality despite the cellular complexity of the brain in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or arrest neurodegeneration. Here, we describe broadly these concepts and their relevance across neurodegenerative diseases."

"The complexity of neurodegeneration restricts the ability to understand and treat the neurological disorders affecting millions of people worldwide. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop new and more effective therapeutic strategies to combat these devastating conditions and that will only be achieved with a better understanding of the biological mechanism associated with disease conditions. Recent studies highlight the role of DNA damage, particularly, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), in the progression of neuronal loss in a broad spectrum of human neurodegenerative diseases. This is not unexpected because neurons are prone to DNA damage due to their non-proliferative nature and high metabolic activity. However, it is not clear if DSBs is a primary driver of neuronal loss in disease conditions or simply occurs concomitant with disease progression. Here, we provide evidence that supports a critical role of DSBs in the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative diseases. Among different kinds of DNA damages, DSBs are the most harmful and perilous type of DNA damage and can lead to cell death if left unrepaired or repaired with error. In this review, we explore the current state of knowledge regarding the role of DSBs repair mechanisms in preserving neuronal function and survival and describe how DSBs could drive the molecular mechanisms resulting in neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We also discuss the potential implications of DSBs as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic marker in patients with neurodegenerative conditions."
"Changes in the levels and activities of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have been described in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. It is only in Huntington disease, however, that gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments have linked BDNF mechanistically with the underlying genetic defect. Altogether, these studies have led to the development of experimental strategies aimed at increasing BDNF levels in the brains of animals that have been genetically altered to mimic the aforementioned human diseases, with a view to ultimately influencing the clinical treatment of these conditions. In this article, we will review the current knowledge about the involvement of BDNF in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, with particular emphasis on Huntington disease, and will provide the rationale for and discuss the problems in proposing BDNF treatment as a beneficial and feasible therapeutic approach in the clinic."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are among the most serious health problems affecting millions of people worldwide. Such diseases are characterized by a progressive degeneration and / or death of neurons in the central nervous system. Currently, there are no therapeutic approaches to cure or even halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. During the last two decades, much attention has been paid to the neuroprotective and anti-neurodegenerative activities of compounds isolated from natural products with high efficacy and low toxicity. Accumulating evidence indicates that berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, may act as a promising anti-neurodegenerative agent by inhibiting the activity of the most important pathogenic enzymes, ameliorating intracellular oxidative stress, attenuating neuroinflammation, triggering autophagy and protecting neurons against apoptotic cell death. This review attempts to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the therapeutic potential of berberine against neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms that underlie its effects on Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases."

A major barrier to developing effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is our incomplete understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms. Genetic screens in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons can elucidate such mechanisms. Genome-wide screens using CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation provide complementary biological insights and may reveal potential therapeutic targets.
"Nutrition and diet have been suggested to enhance or inhibit cognitive performance and the risk of several neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted a systematic review to elucidate the relationship between the inflammatory capacity of a person's diet and the risk of incident neurodegenerative diseases. We searched major medical databases for articles published through June 30, 2018. Original, full-text, English-language articles on studies with human participants which investigated the link between dietary inflammatory potential and risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases were included. Duplicate and irrelevant studies were removed, and data were compiled through critical analysis. Initially, 457 articles were collected via the searching method, of which 196 studies remained after removal of duplicates. Fourteen articles were screened and found to be relevant to the scope of the review. After critical analysis, 10 were included in the final review. In all studies but one, a higher dietary inflammatory index (DII) was related to higher risk of developing neurodegenerative disease symptoms, including memory and cognition decline and multiple sclerosis. Of 3 studies that assessed the association of DII with levels of circulating inflammation markers, 2 indicated that DII was positively correlated with inflammatory marker levels. Low literacy, an unhealthy lifestyle, and individual nutritional status were the factors involved in a diet with inflammatory potential. These findings enhance confidence that DII is an appropriate tool for measurement of dietary inflammatory potential and validate the role of diets with inflammatory potential in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. DII may be correlated with levels of circulating inflammatory markers."

"Purpose of review: Abnormalities of oculomotor control accompany the pathological changes underlying many neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical examination of eye movements can contribute to differential diagnosis, whereas quantitative laboratory measures can provide detailed insight into the disease process. In this review of eye movements in neurodegenerative disease, we summarise recent empirical findings and conceptual advances. Recent findings: Oculomotor researchers continue to be particularly prolific in studying Parkinson's disease but there is also substantial activity in Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. Interesting findings have been reported in Huntington's, motor neuron disease, and glaucoma. Most studies report laboratory-based investigations but useful progress in clinical description continues to be made. Summary: Eye movements remain an active field of investigation across a variety of neurodegenerative conditions. Progress continues to be made at the clinical level as well by using laboratory techniques."
"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jacob, Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are mainly characterized by the massive deposition of misfolded protein aggregates consequent to aberrant production or overexpression of specific proteins. The development of new therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative pathophysiologies currently stands at a crossroads. This presents an opportunity to transition future drug discovery efforts to target disease modification, an area in which much still remains unknown. In this review we examine recent progress in the area of neurodegenerative drug discovery, focusing on some of the most common targets."
"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are genetic parasites, in-between genetics and environment. Few HERVs retain some coding capability. Sometimes, the host has the advantage of some HERV genes; conversely, HERVs may contribute to pathogenesis. The expression of HERVs depends on several factors, and is regulated epigenetically by stimuli such as inflammation, viral and microbial infections, etc. Increased expression of HERVs occurs in physiological and pathological conditions, in one or more body sites. Several diseases have been attributed to one or more HERVs, particularly neurological diseases. The key problem is to differentiate the expression of a HERV as cause or effect of a disease. To be used as a biomarker, a correlation between the expression of a certain HERV and the disease onset and/or behavior must be found. The greater challenge is to establish a pathogenic role. The criteria defining causal connections between HERVs and diseases include the development of animal models, and disease modulation in humans, by anti-HERV therapeutic antibody. So far, statistically significant correlations between HERVs and diseases have been achieved for HERV-W and multiple sclerosis; disease reproduction in transgenic animals was achieved for HERV-W and multiple sclerosis, and for HERV-K and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical trials for both diseases are in progress."
"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are common events that were recognized as one of the most toxic lesions in eukaryotic cells. DSBs are widely involved in many physiological processes such as V(D)J recombination, meiotic recombination, DNA replication and transcription. Deregulation of DSBs has been reported in multiple diseases in human beings, such as the neurodegenerative diseases, with which the underlying mechanisms are needed to be illustrated. Here, we reviewed the recent insights into the dysfunction of DSB formation and repair, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD) and ataxia telangiectasia (A-T)."

"Most of the neurodegenerative diseases that afflict humans manifest with the intraneuronal accumulation of toxic proteins that are aggregate-prone. Extensive data in cell and neuronal models support the concept that such proteins, like mutant huntingtin or alpha-synuclein, are substrates for macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy). Furthermore, autophagy-inducing compounds lower the levels of such proteins and ameliorate their toxicity in diverse animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. However, most of these compounds also have autophagy-independent effects and it is important to understand if similar benefits are seen with genetic strategies that upregulate autophagy, as this strengthens the validity of this strategy in such diseases. Here we review studies in vertebrate models using genetic manipulations of core autophagy genes and describe how these improve pathology and neurodegeneration, supporting the validity of autophagy upregulation as a target for certain neurodegenerative diseases."
"Many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Prion's disease, polyQ and Huntington's disease share abnormal folding of potentially cytotoxic protein species associated with degeneration and death of specific neuronal populations. In order to maintain cellular protein homeostasis, neurons have developed an intrinsic protein quality control system as a strategy to counteract protein aggregation and their toxicity. Heat shock proteins are an essential component for regulating protein quality control and contribute potentially in the process of protein folding, prevent protein aggregation and in disaggregation in several neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, molecular chaperones are considered an exciting therapeutic target. In this book chapter, we will focus on the potential importance of different heat shock proteins in neurodegenerative diseases and understand their mechanisms to protect neurons form aggregates and their toxicity."
"Proteins are major components of the biological functions in a cell. Biology demands that a protein must fold into its stable three-dimensional structure to become functional. In an unfavorable cellular environment, protein may get misfolded resulting in its aggregation. These conformational disorders are directly related to the tissue damage resulting in cellular dysfunction giving rise to different diseases. This way, several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson Huntington diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are caused. Misfolding of the protein is prevented by innate molecular chaperones of different classes. It is envisaged that work on this line is likely to translate the knowledge into the development of possible strategies for early diagnosis and efficient management of such related human diseases. The present review deals with the human neurodegenerative diseases caused due to the protein misfolding highlighting pathomechanisms and therapeutic intervention."

": Novel insights in the development of a precision medicine approach for treating the neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are provided by emerging advances in the field of pharmacoepigenomics. In this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied because of their implication in several disorders related to the central nervous system, as well as for their potential role as biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment. Recent studies in the field of neurodegeneration reported evidence that drug response and efficacy can be modulated by miRNA-mediated mechanisms. In fact, miRNAs seem to regulate the expression of pharmacology target genes, while approved (conventional and non-conventional) therapies can restore altered miRNAs observed in NDDs. The knowledge of miRNA pharmacoepigenomics may offers new clues to develop more effective treatments by providing novel insights into interindividual variability in drug disposition and response. Recently, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs is gaining increasing attention, and miRNA-based drugs (for cancer) have been under observation in clinical trials. However, the effective use of miRNAs as therapeutic target still needs to be investigated. Here, we report a brief review of representative studies in which miRNAs related to therapeutic effects have been investigated in NDDs, providing exciting potential prospects of miRNAs in pharmacoepigenomics and translational medicine."
"Pathogenesis of degenerative diseases is complex and multifaceted. The disease phenotypes depend on the location of injury/damage in the brain networks and pathologically are characterized by loss of brain cells. The reason for this loss appears to be an accumulation of misfolded and dysfunctional proteins that trigger apoptotic cell death. The role of alpha-synuclein mutations, its interaction with other proteins and the cellular environment is discussed in the context of selective neuron loss."
"Rare genetic diseases affect about 7% of the general population and over 7000 distinct clinical syndromes have been described with the majority being due to single gene defects. This review will provide a critical overview of genetic strategies that are being pioneered to halt or reverse disease progression in inherited neurodegenerative diseases. This field of research covers a vast area and only the most promising treatment paradigms will be discussed with a particular focus on inherited eye diseases, which have paved the way for innovative gene therapy paradigms, and mitochondrial diseases, which are currently generating a lot of debate centred on the bioethics of germline manipulation."
"The study of protein misfolding and aggregation saw resurgence in the last decade. Aggregation is the main cause of several human neurodegenerative diseases which makes this field as the leading edge in the science today. Protein aggregation is a highly complex process resulting in formation of a variety of aggregates with different structures and morphologies. Many of them are highly cytotoxic. In-depth knowledge about structure, mechanism of formation, and physiological effects of aggregates will shed new light on the aggregation-mediated cell toxicity, and helps in deciphering new target for drug design and development. This review summarizes the existing information on the molecular mechanism of protein misfolding and aggregation involved in neurodegeneration stressing on the possible therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. As our knowledge about the relation between the protein misfolding and disease pathogenesis will be enhanced, more specific and promising treatment opportunities will come into existence."
"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) represent one of the most important public health problems and concerns, as they are a growing cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in the elderly. Despite remarkable breakthroughs in our understanding of NDs, there has been little success in developing effective therapies. The use of natural products may offer great potential opportunities in the prevention and therapy of NDs; however, many clinical concerns have arisen regarding their use, mainly focusing on the lack of scientific support or evidence for their efficacy and patient safety. These clinical uncertainties raise critical questions from a bioethical and legal point of view, as considerations relating to patient decisional autonomy, patient safety, and beneficial or non-beneficial care may need to be addressed. This paper does not intend to advocate for or against the use of natural products, but to analyze the ethical framework of their use, with particular attention paid to the principles of biomedical ethics. In conclusion, the notable message that emerges is that natural products may represent a great promise for the treatment of many NDs, even if many unknown issues regarding the efficacy and safety of many natural products still remain."
"Inflammation is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. In this Review, we discuss inducers, sensors, transducers, and effectors of neuroinflammation that contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death. Although inducers of inflammation may be generated in a disease-specific manner, there is evidence for a remarkable convergence in the mechanisms responsible for the sensing, transduction, and amplification of inflammatory processes that result in the production of neurotoxic mediators. A major unanswered question is whether pharmacological inhibition of inflammation pathways will be able to safely reverse or slow the course of disease."
"In the last few years, exciting properties have emerged regarding the activation, signaling, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic targeting of the two types of neurotrophin receptors: the p75NTR with its intracellular and extracellular peptides, the Trks, their precursors and their complexes. This review summarizes these new developments, with particular focus on neurodegenerative diseases. Based on the evolving knowledge, innovative concepts have been formulated regarding the pathogenesis of these diseases, especially the Alzheimer's and two other, the Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The medical progresses include original procedures of diagnosis, started from studies in mice and now investigated for human application, based on innovative classes of receptor agonists and blockers. In parallel, comprehensive studies have been and are being carried out for the development of drugs. The relevance of these studies is based on the limitations of the therapies employed until recently, especially for the treatment of Alzheimer's patients. Starting from well known drugs, previously employed for non-neurodegenerative diseases, the ongoing progress has lead to the development of small molecules that cross rapidly the blood-brain barrier. Among these molecules the most promising are specific blockers of the p75NTR receptor. Additional drugs, that activate Trk receptors, were shown effective against synaptic loss and memory deficits. In the near future such approaches, coordinated with treatments with monoclonal antibodies and with developments in the microRNA field, are expected to improve the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases, and may be relevant also for other human disease conditions."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are considered a serious life-threatening issue regardless of age. Resulting nerve damage progressively affects important activities, such as movement, coordination, balance, breathing, speech and the functioning of vital organs. Reports on the subject have concluded that neurodegenerative disease can be caused by mutations of susceptible genes, alcohol consumption, toxins, chemicals and other unknown environmental factors. Although several diagnostic techniques can be used to determine aetiologies, the process is difficult and often fails. Research shows that nasopharyngeal and gut microbiota play important roles in brain to spinal cord coordination. However, no conclusive epidemiologic evidence is available on the roles played by respiratory and gut microbiota in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, understanding the connection between respiratory and gut microbiota and the nervous system could provide information on causal links. The present review describes future perspectives on the role played by nasopharyngeal and gut microbiota in the development of neurodegenerative diseases."
"The most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are known to be protein-misfolding diseases, and characterized by the presence of disease-specific protein aggregates in neuronal and glial cells. Recently, the propagation hypothesis of prion-like protein inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases has been proposed. Many studies have shown that aggregation-prone proteins such as tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 can form aggregates in a seed-dependent and self-templating prion-like manner, and these aggregates can be transferred intercellularly to neighboring cells and seeded for further aggregation. Propagation of aggregated proteins in these diseases may therefore occur through mechanisms similar to those that underlie prion pathogenesis. If this hypothesis is verified in vivo, it will suggest new therapeutic strategies to block the propagation of aggregated proteins throughout the brain."

"Neurodegenerative diseases continue to represent major unmet medical and public health needs and will increasingly strain the healthcare system as people live longer due to medical advances in other diseases. Hopefully the emergence of increased understanding of the biology of these conditions coupled with novel clinical pharmacology tools, clinical trial designs, and regulatory innovation will allow the emergence of highly effective symptomatic and disease modifying pharmacotherapies."
"Recent advances in glial research have elucidated the roles of microglia under various contexts in health and disease. Microglial activation used to be considered only as a consequence of neuronal damage. However, a series of studies using mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease selectively affecting motor neurons, indicated that microglia actively influence the disease course. In this review, we summarize the growing evidence that microglia play a critical role in the survival and demise of motor neurons in ALS. These observations suggest microglia as a promising therapeutic target of neurodegenerative diseases."
"Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to provide an update on comorbidities in neurodegenerative conditions. The term comorbidity is used here to distinguish cases with overlapping pathogenic mechanisms, which includes combinations of neurodegenerative proteinopathies from cases with multimorbidity, which is defined as concomitant brain and systemic disorders with different pathogenic mechanisms. Recent findings: Comorbid proteinopathies are more frequent in both sporadic and hereditary neurodegenerative diseases than previously assumed. The most frequent additional proteinopathies are related to Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disorder, and limbic predominant transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 proteinopathy, however, different forms of tau pathologies are also increasingly recognized. In addition to ageing, synergistic interaction of proteins, common disease pathways, and the influence of genetic variations are discussed as possible pathogenic players. Summary: Comorbid proteinopathies might influence the clinical course and have implications for biomarker and therapeutic development. As pure forms of proteinopathies are still observed, the notion of current molecular classification is justified. This corroborates elucidation of various pathogenic pathways leading to neurodegeneration. Assuming that single proteins and associated pathways are targeted in therapy trials, efforts are needed to better stratify patients and to select pure proteinopathy forms lacking unfavorable genetic constellations. Otherwise combined therapeutic strategies might be necessary for comorbid proteinopathies."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by selective damage to specific neurons in the nervous system. Interest in such diseases in humans has resulted in considerable progress in the molecular understanding of these disorders in recent decades. Numerous neurodegenerative diseases have also been described in domestic animals but relatively little molecular work has been reported. In the present review, we have classified neurodegenerative disease according to neuroanatomical criteria. We have established two large groups, based on whether the neuronal cell body or its axon was primarily affected. Conditions such as motor neuron diseases, cerebellar degenerations and neuroaxonal dystrophies are discussed in terms of their clinical and neuropathological features. In the most studied disorders, we also present what is known about underlying pathomechanisms, and compare them with their human counterparts. The purpose of this review is to re-kindle interest in this group of diseases and to encourage veterinary researchers to investigate molecular mechanisms by taking advantage of current diagnostic tools."
"Increasing evidence suggests that disruption of metal homeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases, Lewy body diseases, and vascular dementia. Conformational changes of disease-related proteins (amyloidogenic proteins), such as β-amyloid protein, prion proteins, and α-synuclein, are well-established contributors to neurotoxicity and to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that these amyloidogenic proteins are metalloproteins that bind trace elements, including zinc, iron, copper, and manganese, and play significant roles in the maintenance of metal homeostasis. We present a current review of the role of trace elements in the functions and toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins, and propose a hypothesis integrating metal homeostasis and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases that is focused on the interactions among metals and between metals and amyloidogenic proteins at the synapse, considering that these amyloidogenic proteins and metals are co-localized at the synapse."
"Throughout the genome, unstable tandem nucleotide repeats can expand to cause a variety of neurologic disorders. Expansion of a CAG triplet repeat within a coding exon gives rise to an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the resultant protein product, and accounts for a unique category of neurodegenerative disorders, known as the CAG-polyglutamine repeat diseases. The nine members of the CAG-polyglutamine disease family include spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington disease, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, and six spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17). All CAG-polyglutamine diseases are dominantly inherited, with the exception of SBMA, which is X-linked, and many CAG-polyglutamine diseases display anticipation, which is defined as increasing disease severity in successive generations of an affected kindred. Despite widespread expression of the different polyQ-expanded disease proteins throughout the body, each CAG-polyglutamine disease strikes a particular subset of neurons, although the mechanism for this cell-type selectivity remains poorly understood. While the different genes implicated in these disorders display amino acid homology only in the repeat tract domain, certain pathologic molecular processes have been implicated in almost all of the CAG-polyglutamine repeat diseases, including protein aggregation, proteolytic cleavage, transcription dysregulation, autophagy impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we highlight the clinical and molecular genetic features of each distinct disorder, and then discuss common themes in CAG-polyglutamine disease pathogenesis, closing with emerging advances in therapy development."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in prevalence in many countries as the average age of their populations increases, since many of these disorders occur more frequently in elderly individuals, placing an increasing burden on healthcare resources. Most neurodegenerative disorders are associated with accumulations of abnormal proteins in the central nervous system (CNS), which result in neuronal degeneration and ultimately neuronal death. Recent developments in molecular pathology and genetics have allowed the identification of the abnormal proteins involved in many neurodegenerative disorders and the genes that encode these proteins. This has led to a fuller understanding of the mechanisms of many of these diseases, but this has not so far been accompanied by major improvements in diagnostic tests or treatments for these disorders. Prion diseases are rare neurodegenerative disorders that are associated with the accumulation of a misfolded host protein, the prion protein, in the CNS. Prion diseases have been considered as a paradigm for protein misfolding diseases, but there are significant differences between prion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders, not least in the transmissible nature of prion diseases. In this review we give an overview of the wide range of neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans, and compare the molecular pathology of prion diseases with other neurodegenerative diseases. The concept of proteinopathy as a common mechanism in neurodegenerative disorders is explored, and we highlight the improvements in diagnosis and management required to improve our treatment of these devastating conditions."
"Central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, are common but difficult to treat. As effective medical interventions are limited, those diseases will likely continue adversely affecting people's health. There is evidence that the hyperactivation of innate immunity is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and polyglutamine diseases. In mammalian and fly CNS, the presence of noninfectious ligands, including danger-associated molecular patterns, is recognized by (micro)glial cells, inducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Such inflammation may contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative states. Studies using fruit flies have shed light on the types of signals, receptors and cells responsible for inducing the inflammation that leads to neurodegeneration. Researchers are using fly models to assess the mechanisms of sterile inflammation in the brain and its link to progressive neurodegeneration. Given the similarity of its physiological system and biochemical function to those of mammals, especially in activating and regulating innate immune signalling, Drosophila can be a versatile model system for studying the mechanisms and biological significance of sterile inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Such knowledge would greatly facilitate the quest for a novel effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases."
"Neurodegenerative and neurobehavioral diseases may be caused by chronic and neuropathic viral infections and may result in a loss of neurons and axons in the central nervous system that increases with age. To date, there is evidence of systemic viral infections that occur with some neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. With increasing lifespan, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases increases consistently. Neurodegenerative diseases affect approximately 37 million people worldwide and are an important cause of mortality. In addition to established non-viral-induced reasons for neurodegenerative diseases, neuropathic infections and viruses associated with neurodegenerative diseases have been proposed. Neuronal degeneration can be either directly or indirectly affected by viral infection. Viruses that attack the human immune system can also affect the nervous system and interfere with classical pathways of neurodegenerative diseases. Viruses can enter the central nervous system, but the exact mechanism cannot be understood well. Various studies have supported viral- and non-viral-mediated neurodegeneration at the cellular, molecular, genomic and proteomic levels. The main focus of this review is to illustrate the association between viral infections and both neurodegenerative and neurobehavioral diseases, so that the possible mechanism and pathway of neurodegenerative diseases can be better explained. This information will strengthen new concepts and ideas for neurodegenerative and neurobehavioral disease treatment."
"Introduction: neurodegenerative diseases cause changes in the level of consciousness or swallowing mechanisms that often necessitate a specialized nutritional support. Objective: review the risk of malnutrition and its treatment in patients with cerebral vascular disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Development: degenerative neurological diseases are one of the main indications for nutritional support in our country. In acute processes (cerebral vascular disease), proper nutritional management is related to better outcomes and reduced complications. In chronic neurodegenerative processes (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and dementia), malnutrition is a major problem that worsens the prognosis of these patients, the proper management of dysphagia and its complications, as well as the use of different stages of support being necessary nutritional. A correct nutritional evaluation of these patients and a right nutrition intervention is essential in monitoring their disease. Finally, in advanced Parkinson's disease, nutritional support, as in previous neurodegenerative diseases, is of huge importance. Protein dietary load and its distribution in the diet of these patients are important, too. Finally, American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition ASPEN recommend, with a degree of evidence B, performing a screening of malnutrition in patients with neurological diseases. Conclusions: a correct nutritional evaluation and adequate nutritional support should be part of diagnostic and therapeutic process of these diseases."
"Genetics and pathology have proven to be an effective combination to identify an evolving and deepening landscape of pathways and potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases. Initially this landscape appeared to be populated with distinct therapeutic targets but with potentially overlapping mechanisms in each neurodegenerative disease. Our understanding has expanded to recognize that multiple pathologies are common in neurodegenerative disease, and that there is considerable overlap in pathways and targets driving neurodegenerative diseases. This potentially opens the way for future treatments to be indicated by tissue pathology and genetic basis rather than clinical phenotype. The potential to treat neurodegenerative disease by addressing underlying pathophysiology is still in the early days and challenges remain, especially the likely need to address pathologies early in disease. This will require redefinition of diagnosis and the tools to enable earlier diagnosis."
"The most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders involve protein misfolding and the aggregation of specific proteins. Autophagy is becoming an attractive target to treat neurodegenerative disorders through the selective degradation of abnormally folded proteins by the lysosomal pathway. However, accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy impairment at different regulatory steps may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. Thus, a complex scenario is emerging where autophagy may play a dual role in neurodegenerative diseases by causing the downstream effect of promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins and an upstream effect where its deregulation perturbs global proteostasis, contributing to disease progression. Challenges in the future development of therapeutic strategies to target the autophagy pathway are discussed."

"Neurodegenerative diseases constitute a major problem of public health that is associated with an increased risk of mortality and poor quality of life. Malnutrition is considered as a major problem that worsens the prognosis of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. In this aspect, the present review is aimed to critically collect and summarize all the available existing clinical data regarding the clinical impact of nutritional assessment in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting on the crucial role of nutritional status in disease progression and management. According to the currently available clinical data, the nutritional status of patients seems to play a very important role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. A correct nutritional evaluation of neurodegenerative disease patients and a right nutrition intervention is essential in monitoring their disease."

"Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are a few examples of debilitating neurological/neurodegenerative diseases for which there are currently no curative treatments. Recent evidence has strongly suggested a role for neuroinflammation in both the onset and progression of these diseases. However, the mechanisms that initiate neuroinflammation are presently unclear. Mounting evidence suggests that environmental factors are likely involved. One proposed mechanism linking both genetic and environmental factors is dysregulation of the antiviral response. Indeed, many mutations that have been linked to neurological conditions occur in genes related to the antiviral response. Although the products of these genes may have potent antiviral activities - they can also have deleterious effects when their expression is not appropriately regulated. For that reason, expression of antiviral genes is a tightly controlled process. Herein, we review the various antiviral genes that have been linked to neurological conditions. We focus specifically on type I interferonopathies, the symptoms of which are often evident at birth, and neurodegenerative diseases, which frequently onset later in life."
"Metabolomics seeks to take a ""snapshot"" in a time of the levels, activities, regulation and interactions of all small molecule metabolites in response to a biological system with genetic or environmental changes. The emerging development in mass spectrometry technologies has shown promise in the discovery and quantitation of neuroactive small molecule metabolites associated with gut microbiota and brain. Significant progress has been made recently in the characterization of intermediate role of small molecule metabolites linked to neural development and neurodegenerative disorder, showing its potential in understanding the crosstalk between gut microbiota and the host brain. More evidence reveals that small molecule metabolites may play a critical role in mediating microbial effects on neurotransmission and disease development. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics is uniquely suitable for obtaining the metabolic signals in bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and brain. In this review, we summarized major mass spectrometry technologies including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and imaging mass spectrometry for metabolomics studies of neurodegenerative disorders. We also reviewed the recent advances in the identification of new metabolites by mass spectrometry and metabolic pathways involved in the connection of intestinal microbiota and brain. These metabolic pathways allowed the microbiota to impact the regular function of the brain, which can in turn affect the composition of microbiota via the neurotransmitter substances. The dysfunctional interaction of this crosstalk connects neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. The mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis provides information for targeting dysfunctional pathways of small molecule metabolites in the development of the neurodegenerative diseases, which may be valuable for the investigation of underlying mechanism of therapeutic strategies."

"Sleep disturbances are common in neurodegenerative diseases. Disturbed sleep can result in fatigue, irritability, morning headaches, impaired motor and cognitive skills, depression, and daytime somnolence. The major sleep complaints include: insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, excessive nocturnal motor activity, circadian sleep-wake rhythm disturbance, and respiratory dysrhythmia. The pathogenetic mechanisms of sleep disturbances may be secondary to direct structural alteration of the sleep-wake generating neurons or from several other indirect mechanisms. At the biochemical level, neurodegenerative diseases may be largely classified as tauopathies, alpha-synucleinopathies, and other diseases. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test are the two most important diagnostic laboratory tests in the evaluation of sleep disturbances. Management of sleep disturbances is complex and is based primarily on the nature of the sleep disturbance. The clinical profiles, pathogenetic mechanisms, PSG findings, and management issues are discussed here with reference to some common neurodegenerative diseases."

"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the neurodegenerative changes or apoptosis of neurons involved in networks, which are important to specific physiological functions. With the development of old-aging society, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is on the increase. However, it is difficult to diagnose for most of neurodegenerative diseases. At present, there are too few effective therapies. Advances in stem cell biology have raised the hope and possibility for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, stem cells have been widely attempted to treat neurodegenerative diseases of animal model. Here we review the progress and prospects of various stem cells, including embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cell and neural stem cells and so on, for the treatments of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington' disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Lou Gehrig's disease."
"The CRISPR/Cas genome editing tool has led to a revolution in biological research. Its ability to target multiple genomic loci simultaneously allows its application in gene function and genomic manipulation studies. Its involvement in the sequence specific gene editing in different backgrounds has changed the scenario of treating genetic diseases. By unravelling the mysteries behind complex neuronal circuits, it not only paved way in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease but helped in the development of large animal models of different neuronal diseases; thereby opened the gateways of successfully treating different neuronal diseases. This review explored the possibility of using of CRISPR/Cas in engineering DNA at the embryonic stage, as well as during the functioning of different cell types in the brain, to delineate implications related to the use of this super-specialized genome editing tool to overcome various neurodegenerative diseases that arise as a result of genetic mutations."
A profound change in thinking about the etiologies of many neurodegenerative diseases has far-reaching implications for developing therapeutics.
Nature Neuroscience presents a special issue of recent advances on shared mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disease.
"Neurodegenerative diseases are a major focus of scientific and clinical interest because of their increasing medical and social importance. Due to the intimate connections between central nervous and endocrine systems, it is reasonable to suspect that important, and in some cases clinically relevant, endocrine modifications may accompany the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Data on endocrine modifications in different neurodegenerative diseases have been reported, but results have often been non-conclusive, or conflicting. Accumulating evidence suggests that the GH/IGF-I axis is involved in the regulation of brain growth, development, and metabolism and in the regulation of muscle function. Dysfunctions in GH/IGF-I axis in most of neurodegenerative diseases are therefore reviewed. Alterations of this system could be actors in the complex network leading to (at least some) neurodegenerative diseases. A thorough effort in investigating every possible involvement is warranted, in the light of future therapeutic strategies."
"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by selective dysfunction and loss of neurons associated with pathologically altered proteins that deposit in the human brain but also in peripheral organs. These proteins and their biochemical modifications can be potentially targeted for therapy or used as biomarkers. Despite a plethora of modifications demonstrated for different neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as amyloid-β, prion protein, tau, α-synuclein, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), or fused in sarcoma protein (FUS), molecular classification of NDDs relies on detailed morphological evaluation of protein deposits, their distribution in the brain, and their correlation to clinical symptoms together with specific genetic alterations. A further facet of the neuropathology-based classification is the fact that many protein deposits show a hierarchical involvement of brain regions. This has been shown for Alzheimer and Parkinson disease and some forms of tauopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies. The present paper aims to summarize current molecular classification of NDDs, focusing on the most relevant biochemical and morphological aspects. Since the combination of proteinopathies is frequent, definition of novel clusters of patients with NDDs needs to be considered in the era of precision medicine. Optimally, neuropathological categorizing of NDDs should be translated into in vivo detectable biomarkers to support better prediction of prognosis and stratification of patients for therapy trials."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of chronic, progressive disorders characterized by the gradual loss of neurons in discrete areas of the central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism(s) underlying their progressive nature remains unknown but a timely and well-controlled inflammatory reaction is essential for the integrity and proper function of the CNS. Substantial evidence has documented a common inflammatory mechanism in various neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that in the diseased CNS, interactions between damaged neurons and dysregulated, overactivated microglia create a vicious self-propagating cycle causing uncontrolled, prolonged inflammation that drives the chronic progression of neurodegenerative diseases. We further propose that dynamic modulation of this inflammatory reaction by interrupting the vicious cycle might become a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases."
"Systems-based investigation of diseases requires integrated analysis of cellular networks and high-throughput data of gene products. The use of genome-scale metabolic networks for such integration has led to the elucidation of cellular mechanisms for several cell types from microorganisms to plants. It has become easier and cheaper to generate high-throughput data over years in the form of transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. This has tremendously improved the quality and quantity of information extracted from such data enabling the documentation of active pathways and reactions in cell metabolism. A number of omics-based datasets for several neurodegenerative diseases are now available in public repositories. This increases the potential of using genome-scale brain metabolic networks as a scaffold for this type of data to map metabolic alterations for the purpose of elucidating disease mechanisms and for the diagnosis and treatment of such disorders. This chapter first reviews omics data collected for neurodegenerative diseases to map their effect on metabolism. Later, the potential for genome-scale metabolic modeling of such data is reviewed and discussed in light of recently reconstructed brain metabolic networks at genome-scale."

"Neuronal homeostasis depends on the proper functioning of quality control systems like autophagy. This mechanism is responsible of the clearance of misfolded proteins, aggregates and the turnover of organelles within the neuron. Autophagic dysfunction has been described in many neurodegenerative diseases. It can occur at several steps of the autophagic machinery and can contribute to the formation of intracellular aggregates and ultimately to neuronal death. Accordingly restoring autophagy activity in affected neurons can be an attractive therapeutic approach to fight neurodegeneration. In this review we summarize the present encouraging strategies that have been achieved with pharmacological and genetic treatments aimed to induce neuronal autophagy in experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases."
"The acute and chronic effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been widely described; however, there is limited knowledge on how a TBI sustained during early adulthood or mid-adulthood will influence aging. Epidemiological studies have explored whether TBI poses a risk for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. We will discuss the influence of TBI and resulting medical comorbidities such as endocrine, sleep, and inflammatory disturbances on age-related gray and white matter changes and cognitive decline. Post mortem studies examining amyloid, tau, and other proteins will be discussed within the context of neurodegenerative diseases and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The data support the suggestion that pathological changes triggered by an earlier TBI will have an influence on normal aging processes and will interact with neurodegenerative disease processes rather than the development of a specific disease, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Chronic neurophysiologic change after TBI may have detrimental effects on neurodegenerative disease."
"This work critically reviews chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with a specific focus on the single criterion necessary and sufficient for diagnosis. Herein, CTE is compared to other well-established neurodegenerative entities including Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Each neurodegenerative disorder is reviewed in five pertinent areas: 1) historical perspective, 2) guideline formation process, 3) clinical diagnostic criteria, 4) pathological diagnostic criteria, and 5) validation of previously described diagnostic criteria (e.g., sensitivity and specificity). These comparisons indicate that CTE is a disease in the earliest stages of formation and has yet to undergo rigorous development and refinement similar to other neurodegenerative diseases. Suggested future revisions to the diagnostic criterion of CTE include establishing a lower threshold for accumulation of pathology, as well as accounting for the presence of concomitant neuropathology and comorbid neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, while initial efforts have been attempted, agreed upon antemortem clinical criteria do not exist. As has been the scientific standard with similar neurodegenerative disorders, antemortem diagnostic guidelines should first be refined through subcommittees of neuroscientists from diverse institutional backgrounds with a subclassification of levels of diagnostic certainty (possible, probably, and definite). Validation studies should then assess the predictive value and accuracy of proposed antemortem diagnostic criteria in relation to potential pathological criteria."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are major world wide causes of morbidity and mortality. They form a heterogeneous group of diseases, ranging from rare monogenic inherited errors of metabolism to common multi-factorial dementias. Major research efforts focus on the development of disease modifying drugs for neurodegenerative diseases. As a result, there follows a need for reliable tools for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of therapy. Processes in the brain can be monitored by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several CSF biomarkers of pathological processes in the brain are now available. Such biomarkers may be used for both research and in the clinical setting. However, several difficult problems remain to be solved. More intensive collaboration between academia, industry and government is likely needed to develop treatments and biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the definitions, usage and current limitations of CSF biomarkers in this field."

"Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and the incidences increase as the population ages. Disease-modifying therapy that prevents or slows disease progression is still lacking, making neurodegenerative diseases an area of high unmet medical need. Target-based drug discovery for disease-modifying agents has been ongoing for many years, without much success due to incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Phenotypic screening, starting with a disease-relevant phenotype to screen for compounds that change the outcome of biological pathways rather than activities at certain specific targets, offers an alternative approach to find small molecules or targets that modulate the key characteristics of neurodegeneration. Phenotypic screens that focus on amelioration of disease-specific toxins, protection of neurons from degeneration, or promotion of neuroregeneration could be potential fertile grounds for discovering therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will summarize the progress of compound screening using these phenotypic-based strategies for this area, with a highlight on unique considerations for disease models, assays, and screening methodologies. We will further provide our perspectives on how best to use phenotypic screening to develop drug leads for neurodegenerative diseases."
"Neuroinflammation is considered a chronic activation of the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) in response to different injuries. This brain immune activation results in various events: circulating immune cells infiltrate the CNS; resident cells are activated; and pro-inflammatory mediators produced and released induce neuroinflammatory brain disease. The effect of immune diffusible mediators on synaptic plasticity might result in CNS dysfunction during neuroinflammatory brain diseases. The CNS dysfunction may induce several human pathological conditions associated with both cognitive impairment and a variable degree of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, age has a powerful effect on enhanced susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases and age-dependent enhanced neuroinflammatory processes may play an important role in toxin generation that causes death or dysfunction of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases This review will address current understanding of the relationship between ageing, neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease by focusing on the principal mechanisms by which the immune system influences the brain plastic phenomena. Also, the present review considers the principal human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and psychiatric disorders caused by aging and neuroinflammation."
"Over the past 20 years, stem cell technologies have become an increasingly attractive option to investigate and treat neurodegenerative diseases. In the current review, we discuss the process of extending basic stem cell research into translational therapies for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. We begin with a discussion of the burden of these diseases on society, emphasizing the need for increased attention toward advancing stem cell therapies. We then explain the various types of stem cells utilized in neurodegenerative disease research, and outline important issues to consider in the transition of stem cell therapy from bench to bedside. Finally, we detail the current progress regarding the applications of stem cell therapies to specific neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. With a greater understanding of the capacity of stem cell technologies, there is growing public hope that stem cell therapies will continue to progress into realistic and efficacious treatments for neurodegenerative diseases."
"According to the projections of the statistical office of the European Union, Eurostat, nearly one third of EU citizens will be at least 65 in 2060. The U.S. population age 65 and older continues to increase and is projected to nearly double from 48 million to 88 million by 2050. Elderly people are especially exposed to neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The most common ND is Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic and progressive disorder with a variety of pathological changes within neuronal tissue, which begin even 10-15 years before the onset of cognitive impairment symptoms. AD is perceived as a disease continuum and considered to include three basic phases: preclinical (asymptomatic) stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia due to AD. A very important issue, from medical and legal perspectives, is the NDs patient's consent to medical procedures, including diagnostic procedures, such as lumber puncture. NDs patients are not always able to express their consent and do not always understand the information provided by a physician. This applies to a group of patients in the final stages of NDs. This paper presents legal regulations of selected European countries and signalizes the U.S. legal solutions on the issue of NDs patients' informed consent to medical procedures."
"Purpose of review: A major goal of current clinical research in neurodegenerative diseases is to improve early detection of disease and presymptomatic detection of neuronal dysfunction. We also need better tools to assess disease progression in this group of disorders. Currently, many potential disease-modifying therapies are being developed and evaluated at the preclinical stage, and will lead to clinical trials in the near future for which biomarkers are urgently needed. This review summarizes the field of biomarker research in the major neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings: Many different approaches are being undertaken to identify biomarkers and include imaging, neurophysiological and cognitive testing in addition to newer technologies such as biochemical, proteomic, metabanomic and gene array profiling of tissue and biofluids from patients. Key recent findings in each of these areas are discussed. Summary: The ideal biomarker needs to be easy to quantify and measure, reproducible, not subject to wide variation in the general population and unaffected by co-morbid factors. For evaluation of therapies the biomarker needs to change linearly with disease progression and closely correlate with established clinico-pathological parameters of the disease. It is unlikely that any one biomarker will fulfil all these characteristics, and it is likely that more than one biomarker will be needed for early diagnosis and similarly for evaluation of disease progression for therapeutic trials. For example, the combination of more detailed clinical assessments encompassing specific cognitive and neurophysiological testing, in addition to imaging, biochemical and genomic profiling, is likely to be needed."
"Young-onset dementia is a neurologic syndrome that affects behavior and cognition of patients younger than 65 years of age. Although frequently misdiagnosed, a systematic approach, reliant upon attainment of a detailed medical history, a collateral history, neuropsychological testing, laboratory studies, and neuroimaging, may facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis with subsequent intervention. The differential diagnosis of young-onset dementia is extensive and includes early-onset forms of adult neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementias, Huntington's disease, and prion disease. Late-onset forms of childhood neurodegenerative conditions may also present as young-onset dementia and include mitochondrial disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, and leukodystrophies. Potentially reversible etiologies including inflammatory disorders, infectious diseases, toxic/metabolic abnormalities, transient epileptic amnesia, obstructive sleep apnea, and normal pressure hydrocephalus also represent important differential diagnostic considerations in young-onset dementia. This review will present etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and options for management of young-onset dementia with comprehensive summary tables for clinical reference."
"The pathway leading from soluble and monomeric to hyperphosphorylated, insoluble and filamentous tau protein is at the centre of many human neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as tauopathies. Dominantly inherited mutations in MAPT, the gene that encodes tau, cause forms of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism, proving that dysfunction of tau is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. However, most cases of tauopathy are not inherited in a dominant manner. The first tau aggregates form in a few nerve cells in discrete brain areas. These become self propagating and spread to distant brain regions in a prion-like manner. The prevention of tau aggregation and propagation is the focus of attempts to develop mechanism-based treatments for tauopathies."
"Transglutaminase catalyzes a covalent bond between peptide-bound glutamine residues and either lysine-bound peptide residues or mono- or polyamines. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that transglutaminase is involved in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington disease (HD), and Parkinson disease. In all of the neurodegenerative diseases examined to date, transglutaminase enzyme activity is upregulated in selectively vulnerable brain regions, transglutaminase proteins are associated with inclusion bodies characteristic of the diseases, and prominent proteins in the inclusion bodies are modified by transglutaminase enzymes. These prominent proteins in the inclusion bodies, including tau, alpha-synuclein, and huntingtin protein, are modified by transglutaminase in vitro and alpha-synuclein and huntingtin protein are modified in cells in culture. Similar changes in transglutaminase and transglutaminase-modified proteins are replicated in transgenic mouse models of the neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Lastly, inhibition of transglutaminase either via drug treatments or molecular approaches is beneficial for the treatment of HD transgenic mice but has yet to be explored for the other neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to determine the specific role(s) that transglutaminase plays in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases with possible implications for transglutaminase as a therapeutic target."
